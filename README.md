## BIO
I am a Ph.D. research scholar at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology Patna, Bihar, India, under the guidance of Prof. Prabhat Kumar. Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree at Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam University, Lucknow, where I was mentored by Prof. Arvind Kumar Tiwari. My primary research interests lie in the fields of Deep/Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Science.

I am deeply passionate about leveraging Machine/Deep Learning algorithms to address societal challenges and enhance their utility across various domains such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence. In my research endeavors, my objective is to learn, make an impact, and genuinely enhance scientific discovery and everyday life. To achieve this, I seek out real-world problems, design algorithms to address them, validate their correctness, and ultimately demonstrate their practical applicability.
